A repository of some of my project work while pursuing a Master of Science in Applied Statistics at Villanova University


MAT 8406: Regression Methods; the project analyzed energy consumption/production activity at the state level, as well as related natural resource and related metrics

MAT 8444: Time Series & Forecasting; the project analyzed electricity demand (consumption) for the NYISO (New York) and ISONE (New England) regions across mid-2015 through early 2019 using time series analysis methods (regression with ARMA error model, plus spectral analysis)

MAT 8446: Survival Analysis; the project analyzed clinical trial data from ClinicalTrials.gov for which types of trials tended to have longer/shorter project lifecycles

MAT 8800: Independent Study of Bayesian Regression with R and Stan; analyzed 2012, 2014, and 2016 Congressional (House) elections data with Bayesian logistic regression models
